<h2><b><u>First generation (A40/A50; 1978)</u></b></h2>
    <p>The Supra was based on the Toyota Celica liftback, but was longer by 129.5 mm (5.10 in). It was offered with either a 2.0 L or 82 kW 2.6-liter 12-valve SOHC inline-six engine, with electronic fuel injection.

<h2><b><u>Second generation (A60; 1981)</u></b></h2>

    <p>Toyota redesigned the Celica Supra and entire Celica lineup for the 1982 model year, with key differences such as the design of the front end, inline-six engine, and wider wheelbase. The Soarer coupe was offered in Japan, while the Celica Camry was realigned with the Chaser in North America.</p>
