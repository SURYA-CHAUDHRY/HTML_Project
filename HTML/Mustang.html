<h1 id="105"><b>Ford Mustang</b></h1> 
   <p>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. It is the longest-produced Ford car nameplate and is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. Robert J. Eggert, Ford Division market research manager, suggested the Mustang name for Ford's new concept car, which was tested by focus groups and came out on top. However, the name was owned by Krupp and Kreidler, so Mustangs were sold in Germany as "T-5s" until December 1978.</p>

<h2><b><u>First generation (1965–1973)</u></b></h2>

   <p>Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project, which was a two-seat mid-mounted engine roadster with a German Ford Taunus V4 engine. The 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car was designed with a lower roof and Gale Halderman's side view design was the basis for the first clay model.</p>

<h2><b><u>Second generation (1974–1978)</u></b></h2>
   <p>Iacocca ordered a smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974, based on the Ford Pinto subcompact. It was introduced two months before the 1973 oil crisis and sold 385,993 cars. It was an early example of downsizing among Detroit's Big Three during the "malaise era". It was finished to a high standard and was heavier due to new U.S. emission and safety regulations. The 1974 Mustang was available in coupe and hatchback versions, including a luxury Ghia model.
   </p>
   <p>Changes introduced for 1975 included an "MPG" model, a "Stallion" trim package, a "Cobra II" version, and a "King Cobra" in 1978. The 1977–1978 hatchback models were now available with the T-top roof option.</p>

<h2><b><u>Third generation (1979–1993)</u></b></h2>
   <p>The 1979 Mustang was based on the Fox platform and had a larger body with an increased wheelbase. Available trim levels included a base model (1979–1981), Ghia (1979–1981), Cobra (1979–1981, 1993), L (1982–1984), GL (1982–1983), GT (1982–1993), Turbo GT (1983–1984), LX (1984–1993), GT-350 20th anniversary edition (1984), SVO (1984–1986) and Cobra R (1993). Engines and drivetrains carried over from the Mustang II, including the 2.3 L I4, 2.8 L V6, and 4.9 L V8 engines. The Mustang was restyled from 1979 to 1986 to reflect the "aero" style of the Ford Taurus. It was selected as the 1979 Official Indianapolis 500 Pace Car and featured special body-appearance parts.</p>
   <p>In 1983, the Mustang convertible was restyled with new grilles and "blue oval" Ford emblems. 1985 Mustangs received another front-fascia restyle.</p>

<h2><b><u>Fourth generation (1994–2004)</u></b></h2>
    <p>In November 1993, the Mustang debuted its first major redesign in fifteen years. It was based on an updated version of the rear-wheel drive Fox platform called "Fox-4". The base model had a 3.8 OHV V6 engine rated at 145 bhp or 150 bhp, and was mated to a 5-speed manual or optional 4-speed automatic transmission. In 1999, the Mustang was reskinned with Ford's New Edge styling theme, and the powertrains were carried over for 1999. In 2004, a 3.9 L variant of the Essex engine replaced the standard 3.8 L mid year with an increase of 3 ftlb (4 Nm) of torque and NVH improvements. There were also three alternate models offered in this generation.</p>
