<h1 id="103"><b>Dodge Challenger</b></h1>
    <p>The Dodge Challenger was a three-car automobile model marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler LLC since 1970. It was designed to compete against cars like the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang, while offering virtually every engine in Chrysler's inventory. The Challenger's longer wheelbase, larger dimensions and more luxurious interior were prompted by the launch of the 1967 Mercury Cougar. The exterior design was done by Carl Cameron, who also did the exterior for the 1966 Dodge Charger. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year.</p>

<h2><b><u>First generation (1970-1974)</u></b></h2>

<h2><b><u>Second generation (1978-1983)</u></b></h2>
    <p>The Challenger name was revived in 1978 for a version of the early Mitsubishi Galant Lambda coupe, sold through Dodge dealers as a captive import. It had a four-cylinder engine and was a brisk performer due to its 2.6 L engine, which pioneered the use of balance shafts.</p>
